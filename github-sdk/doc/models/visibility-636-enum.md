# Visibility 636 Enum

The selected visibility of the packages.  This parameter is optional and only filters an existing result set.

The `internal` visibility is only supported for GitHub Packages registries that allow for granular permissions. For other ecosystems `internal` is synonymous with `private`.
For the list of GitHub Packages registries that support granular permissions, see "[About permissions for GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/packages/learn-github-packages/about-permissions-for-github-packages#granular-permissions-for-userorganization-scoped-packages)."

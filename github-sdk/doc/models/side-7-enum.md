# Side 7 Enum

In a split diff view, the side of the diff that the pull request's changes appear on. Can be `LEFT` or `RIGHT`. Use `LEFT` for deletions that appear in red. Use `RIGHT` for additions that appear in green or unchanged lines that appear in white and are shown for context. For a multi-line comment, side represents whether the last line of the comment range is a deletion or addition. For more information, see "[Diff view options](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests#diff-view-options)" in the GitHub Help documentation.
